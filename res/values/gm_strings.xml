<string name="lorem_ipsum">The GamesCrafters research and development group was formed in 2001 as a &quot;watering hole&quot; to gather and engage top undergraduates as they explore the fertile area of computational game theory. At the core of the project is GAMESMAN, an open-source AI architecture developed for solving, playing, and analyzing two-person abstract strategy games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess). Programmers can easily prototype a new game with multiple rule variants, learn the strategy via color-coded value moves (win = go = green, tie = caution = yellow, lose = stop = red), solve it (in the strong sense), and then play it perfectly and perform extended analysis.</string>
